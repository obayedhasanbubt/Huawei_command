The method for starting and stopping viewing logs on a Huawei backbone switch depends on the specific switch model and software version. However, the general approach is similar across different models.

Starting Log Viewing:

Access the switch console or CLI: Connect to the switch console using a terminal emulator or access the switch CLI remotely through SSH or Telnet.

Enter privilege mode: If you're not already in privilege mode, enter the privilege mode by typing enable and providing the enable password when prompted.

Enter system view mode: Enter system view mode by typing system-view.

Enter the log view mode: Enter log view mode by typing display logbuffer.

Specify the log type: Optionally, you can specify the type of log to view by typing display logbuffer type logtype, where logtype is the specific log type, such as alarms, traffic, or security.

Stopping Log Viewing:

Exit log view mode: To stop viewing logs, simply exit log view mode by typing quit.

Exit system view mode: Exit system view mode by typing quit.

Exit privilege mode (optional): If you want to exit privilege mode, type exit.

Here's an example of how to start viewing logs on a Huawei backbone switch:

user@switch# enable
Enter enable password:
<enable password>
user@switch(config)# system-view
[System-view]
[System-view]display logbuffer
Here's an example of how to stop viewing logs on a Huawei backbone switch:

To find out the connected devices to a Huawei network switch via CLI, you can use the following commands:

    Check the MAC address table: Use the command "display mac-address" to view the MAC address table of the switch. 
    This will show you all of the MAC addresses that the switch has learned and the interfaces they are associated with. 
    You can then use a MAC address lookup tool to identify the manufacturer and potentially the device type.

    Check the ARP table: Use the command "display arp" to view the ARP table of the switch. 
    This will show you the IP addresses and MAC addresses of devices that have communicated with the switch recently. 
    You can then use a MAC address lookup tool to identify the manufacturer and potentially the device type.

    Check the interface status: Use the command "display interface brief" to view the status of all interfaces on the switch. 
    This will show you which interfaces are up and which are down, as well as the speed and duplex settings. 
    You can use this information to identify connected devices by checking the corresponding ports on the switch.

    Check the LLDP neighbors: Use the command "display lldp neighbor" to view the LLDP neighbors of the switch. 
    This will show you information about neighboring devices that support the LLDP protocol, including their device type, port, 
    and hostname.

In summary, to find out the connected devices to a Huawei network switch via CLI, 
you can use commands such as "display mac-address", "display arp", "display interface brief", and "display lldp neighbor". 
These commands will provide you with information about the MAC addresses, IP addresses, interfaces, and neighboring devices 
connected to the switch.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#ChatGPT

Enter the system view mode by typing the following command:
system-view

For example, if the MAC address you're searching for is "0011-2233-4455", use the following command:
display mac-address 0011-2233-4455

For example, to search for MAC addresses on interface GigabitEthernet 0/1/1,
display mac-address GigabitEthernet 0/1/1

You can also search for MAC addresses associated with a specific VLAN.
display mac-address vlan 10
display mac-address vlan 4 GigabitEthernet 0/1/1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
display lldp statistics
display lldp local

#view the LLDP neighbors of the switch. This will show you information about neighboring devices that support the LLDP protocol,
#including their device type, port, and hostname.
display lldp neighbor
display lldp neighbor brief
display lldp neighbor interface XGigabitEthernet 2/2/4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#ChatGPT

In the output of "display lldp neighbor brief" command on a Huawei network switch, "XGE2/0/6" and "GE3/0/8" are both interface names that represent different ports on the switch.

The main difference between these two interface names is that "XGE2/0/6" refers to a 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GE) port, while "GE3/0/8" refers to a Gigabit Ethernet (GE) port.

The "X" in "XGE" stands for 10, which denotes the port's speed of 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps). On the other hand, the absence of the "X" in "GE" indicates that the port's speed is 1 Gigabit per second.

Therefore, "XGE2/0/6" is a 10GE port on slot 2, subcard 0, and port 6, while "GE3/0/8" is a GE port on slot 3, subcard 0, and port 8.

you started running huawei backbone switch instead of cisco backbone switch. Cisco edge switches lost some of their VLAN configurations. when you create vlan configuration on cisco edge switch the colour of port  connection on device turns from orange to yellow. explain why

The port color change from orange to yellow when you create a VLAN configuration on a Cisco edge switch after migrating to a Huawei backbone switch is likely due to a mismatch in the VLAN trunking protocol (VTP) configuration between the two types of switches.

Cisco and Huawei switches use different VTP versions and implementations. By default, Cisco switches use VTP version 2, while Huawei switches use VTP version 3. If the VTP configuration is not compatible between the two types of switches, it can cause problems with VLAN trunking and can also cause the port color to change to yellow.

To fix the problem, you need to make sure that the VTP configuration is compatible between the Cisco edge switches and the Huawei backbone switch. You can do this by either changing the VTP version on the Cisco edge switches to VTP version 3, or by changing the VTP mode on the Huawei backbone switch to VTP transparent mode.

Here are some tips for configuring VTP between Cisco and Huawei switches:

If you are using VTP version 2, make sure that the VTP domain name and VTP password are the same on all of the switches.
If you are using VTP version 3, make sure that the VTP mode is set to server on the Huawei backbone switch and to client on the Cisco edge switches.
If you are using VTP transparent mode on the Huawei backbone switch, make sure that the VTP domain name and VTP password are the same on all of the switches.
Once you have configured VTP correctly, the port color should change back to green.

Here are some additional reasons why the port color might change to yellow:

The port is not configured as a trunk port.
The port is not connected to a trunk port on another switch.
There is a problem with the cable connecting the port to another switch.
There is a problem with the trunk port on another switch.
If you have configured VTP correctly and the port color is still yellow, you can try the following:

Check the port configuration to make sure that it is configured as a trunk port.
Make sure that the port is connected to a trunk port on another switch.
Try replacing the cable connecting the port to another switch.
Try connecting the port to a different trunk port on another switch.
If you have tried all of the above and the port color is still yellow, you may need to contact your vendor for support.

you started running huawei backbone switch instead of cisco backbone switch. Cisco edge switches lost some of their VLAN configurations. when you create vlan configuration on cisco edge switch the colour of port  connection on device turns from orange to yellow. when you configure vtp transparent mode on cisco edge switches but not on huawei backbone switch. the problem looks resolved.explain why

When you configure VTP transparent mode on the Cisco edge switches, you are disabling VTP on the Cisco edge switches. This means that the Cisco edge switches will no longer try to synchronize their VLAN configurations with the Huawei backbone switch.

This is likely the reason why the problem looks resolved. When VTP is enabled on the Cisco edge switches, they will try to synchronize their VLAN configurations with the Huawei backbone switch. However, the Huawei backbone switch uses a different VTP version and implementation than the Cisco edge switches. This can cause problems with VLAN trunking and can also cause the port color to change to yellow.

When you configure VTP transparent mode on the Cisco edge switches, they will no longer try to synchronize their VLAN configurations with the Huawei backbone switch. This will prevent the problems with VLAN trunking and will also cause the port color to change back to green.

Here are some additional benefits of using VTP transparent mode:

VTP transparent mode can help to improve the security of your network by preventing unauthorized changes to VLAN configurations.
VTP transparent mode can also help to improve the performance of your network by reducing the amount of traffic that is generated by VTP.
Overall, VTP transparent mode is a good option to use when you have a network that consists of switches from different vendors.

you started running huawei backbone switch instead of cisco backbone switch. Cisco edge switches lost some of their VLAN configurations. when you create vlan configuration on cisco edge switch the colour of port  connection on device turns from orange to yellow. when you configure vtp transparent mode on cisco edge switches but not on huawei backbone switch. the problem looks resolved.explain why

When you introduce a Huawei backbone switch into an existing network where Cisco switches were originally configured, issues with VLAN configurations and port status color changes can occur. By configuring VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) transparent mode on the Cisco edge switches and not on the Huawei backbone switch, you effectively isolate the VLAN management domains. This configuration can help address the issues and prevent further conflicts. Here's why:

VTP and VLAN Configuration:

Cisco Switches: In the Cisco environment, VTP is a protocol used to manage and distribute VLAN configurations across the network. When a switch is configured as a VTP server or client, it can send and receive updates about VLANs from other switches. This allows for centralized VLAN management.

Huawei Switch: Huawei switches might not use VTP, and their VLAN configurations may not be compatible with Cisco's VTP updates.

VTP Transparent Mode:

Cisco Edge Switches: When configured in VTP transparent mode, Cisco switches do not participate in the VTP domain. They neither send nor receive VTP updates. This mode is typically used when you want to prevent accidental changes from affecting the VLAN configurations on the switch.

Huawei Backbone Switch: The Huawei switch doesn't participate in VTP, and as such, it's unaware of the VTP updates generated by the Cisco switches. It continues to operate based on its own VLAN configurations.

By configuring the Cisco edge switches in VTP transparent mode, you effectively disconnect them from the VTP domain, which means:

They no longer listen to VTP advertisements from other switches, including the Huawei switch.
They don't send VTP advertisements to the network, so they won't interfere with the Huawei switch or other devices that may still be participating in VTP.
This setup can help maintain the stability of the VLAN configurations on both the Huawei and Cisco switches. It prevents potential conflicts that could result from differences in VTP management between the two switch types.

It's important to note that while VTP transparent mode can help avoid VTP-related issues, it also means that you'll need to manage VLAN configurations manually on the Cisco switches. Any changes made on the Huawei switch won't automatically propagate to the Cisco switches. If you need consistent VLAN configurations across the entire network, you may need to revisit the VTP configuration on the Huawei switch or use alternative methods for managing VLANs.

you started running huawei backbone switch instead of cisco backbone switch. You have cisco edge switches running. explain if you need stp protocol configured in this environment.

In a network environment where you've replaced the Cisco backbone switch with a Huawei backbone switch while retaining Cisco edge switches, it's essential to consider the need for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). STP plays a crucial role in preventing loops and ensuring network stability. Here are some important factors to consider:

Mixed Vendor Environment:

When you have a mixed vendor environment like this, it's possible that there may be variations in how Cisco and Huawei switches implement the STP protocol. Both vendors are likely to support the IEEE 802.1D STP standard, but there might be proprietary extensions or optimizations that could lead to incompatibilities.

STP Mode:

Cisco switches typically run the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) or the newer Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) for faster convergence and better load balancing. Huawei switches often support MSTP as well. When you mix different STP modes, it could lead to unexpected behaviors and potential network disruptions.

Bridge Priority:

Cisco and Huawei switches might have different default bridge priorities for STP. A lower bridge priority implies a more preferred root bridge. If not configured properly, it might result in one vendor's switch becoming the root bridge, which could affect the network's intended topology.

Consistency:

To maintain network stability, it's a good practice to ensure STP configurations are consistent across the network. While the Huawei backbone switch may interoperate with the Cisco switches, potential issues could arise due to differences in default settings or unexpected behaviors.

Given these considerations, here's what you should do:

Review and Standardize STP Configurations: If you plan to use STP in the network, standardize the STP configurations across all switches. Ensure that all switches run the same version (RSTP or MSTP), and consider adjusting bridge priorities to align with your desired root bridge.

Test the Network: Before deploying the mixed network in a production environment, conduct thorough testing. This includes testing failover scenarios, checking for any potential inconsistencies or issues, and verifying that the network behaves as expected.

Consider Alternatives: Depending on your network's requirements and complexity, you might also explore alternative redundancy and loop prevention mechanisms, such as Link Aggregation (LACP) or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).

Vendor Support: Contact the vendors (Cisco and Huawei) for specific guidance and compatibility information related to STP in a mixed vendor environment.

Ultimately, the decision to use STP in this mixed environment should be made cautiously and after thorough testing. Ensuring consistent configurations and potential vendor-specific adjustments will be crucial in maintaining network stability and preventing unexpected issues.

you started running huawei backbone switch instead of cisco backbone switch. You have cisco edge switches running. explain if you need stp protocol configured in this environment.

Yes, you need STP protocol configured in this environment even though you are using a Huawei backbone switch and Cisco edge switches. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used to prevent bridging loops on networks. A bridging loop is a network topology in which two or more switches are connected to each other in a loop. This can cause problems with traffic forwarding and can also cause network outages.

STP works by blocking redundant links in a network topology. This creates a single, active path between any two points on the network. If a link fails, STP will unblock a redundant link to maintain connectivity between the two points.

STP is important to use in any network that has two or more switches. This is because even small networks can be susceptible to bridging loops. For example, if you have two switches connected to each other and one of the switches is connected to a server, a bridging loop can occur if the server is also connected to one of the switches.

STP is supported by both Cisco and Huawei switches. You can configure STP using the switch's configuration interface.

Here are some additional benefits of using STP:

STP can help to improve the performance of your network by reducing the amount of traffic that is broadcast on the network.
STP can also help to improve the reliability of your network by preventing network outages.
Overall, STP is an important protocol to use in any network that has two or more switches. This is because STP can help to improve the performance, reliability, and security of your network.

Sure, here is a root-cause analysis (RCA) of the ARP Miss Attack incident based on the provided log entry:

Incident: ARP Miss Attack

Date/Time: December 4, 2023, at 04:31:55+03:00

Affected Device: Huawei Quidway  switch

Description: An ARP Miss Attack occurred on the XGigabitEthernet2/0/0 interface of the switch. The attacker sent 6 ARP requests per second for nonexistent IP addresses, flooding the network with unnecessary traffic. This attack could potentially degrade network performance, increase CPU usage, and disrupt network connectivity.

Root Cause Analysis:

Unauthorized IP Address Usage: The source IP address of the attack (172.16.33.8) is not assigned to any legitimate device on the network. This suggests that the attacker is using an unauthorized IP address to launch the attack.

Lack of ARP Security Measures: ARP security features, such as IP address validation, DHCP snooping, and ARP rate limiting, are not enabled on the switch. This allowed the attacker to flood the network with ARP requests without being blocked.

Potential Compromise of Attacker Device: The attacker's device may be compromised with malware or have misconfigured network settings that are causing it to send unauthorized ARP requests.

Corrective Actions:

Verify IP Address Assignment: Confirm that all devices on the network are using authorized IP addresses. If the source IP address is assigned to a legitimate device, investigate the device for potential compromise or misconfigurations.

Enable ARP Security Features: Enable ARP security features on the switch to prevent unauthorized devices from using IP addresses and reduce the impact of ARP Miss Attacks.

Investigate Attacker Device: If possible, identify the source of the attack and investigate the attacker's device for potential compromise or misconfigurations.

Continuously Monitor Network Traffic: Continuously monitor network traffic for any further ARP Miss Attacks or other suspicious activity.

Preventing Future Incidents:

Strong IP Address Management: Implement strict IP address management policies to ensure only authorized devices are assigned valid IP addresses.

Regular Network Audits: Conduct regular network audits to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

Network Security Awareness Training: Educate network users about ARP Miss Attacks and the importance of using only authorized IP addresses and network configurations.

Up-to-date Software and Firmware: Ensure all network devices are running the latest software and firmware versions to address known vulnerabilities.

explain this Huawei Quidway  :

Security Measures:
Implement or reinforce security measures to mitigate ARP miss attacks. This might involve enabling ARP inspection or rate-limiting ARP requests on the switch.

The Huawei Quidway  is a series of high-performance switches designed for enterprise-level networking. To enhance security and mitigate Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) miss attacks, the switch offers various features that can be configured:

Security Measures Available on Huawei Quidway :
ARP Inspection (Dynamic ARP Inspection - DAI):

DAI helps prevent ARP spoofing attacks by validating ARP packets before updating the switch's ARP table. It verifies the IP-to-MAC address bindings to ensure they are valid and discard suspicious or unauthorized ARP packets.
Rate Limiting ARP Requests:

This involves controlling the rate at which ARP requests are processed or forwarded by the switch. Limiting the number of ARP requests per second can prevent excessive traffic and potential ARP flooding attacks.
How to Implement These Security Measures:
Enabling ARP Inspection (DAI):

Configure DAI on the switch to inspect ARP packets. It involves identifying trusted interfaces (where legitimate ARP requests are expected) and enabling DAI globally or per interface.

DAI configuration typically includes specifying trusted ports, enabling ARP validation, setting ARP inspection rate limits, and determining the action for invalid ARP packets (e.g., drop or log).

Example Configuration Command:

[Quidway] arp anti-attack check user-bind enable
[Quidway] interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1
[Quidway-GigabitEthernet0/0/1] arp anti-attack trust enable


Rate Limiting ARP Requests:

Limit the rate of ARP requests received or transmitted by the switch to prevent ARP flooding attacks.

Example Configuration Command:

[Quidway] arp anti-attack rate-limit enable
[Quidway] arp anti-attack rate-limit 100

Benefits:
Enhanced Security: These measures help protect the network infrastructure by verifying and controlling ARP traffic, reducing the risk of ARP-based attacks like ARP spoofing and ARP flooding.

Prevention of Network Disruptions: Mitigating ARP miss attacks can prevent network congestion caused by excessive ARP requests or unauthorized ARP packets, ensuring smoother network operations.

By enabling ARP inspection and rate-limiting ARP requests on the Huawei Quidway  switch, administrators can bolster the network's security posture and minimize the impact of potential ARP-based security threats. These configurations should be implemented in accordance with best practices and security requirements specific to the network environment.
